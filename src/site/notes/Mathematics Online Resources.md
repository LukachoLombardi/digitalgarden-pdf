This is a small collection of mostly YouTube Channels and series that can serve as a pretty good supplement to the lectures!

# Channels
- [The Bright Side of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/@brightsideofmaths): Check out their Real Analysis Series. It's way more compact and visually well explained than the Ana1 lectures could ever be.

# Series
- [Introduction to Higher Mathematics by Bill Shillito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMWFmjlB8v0&list=PLZzHxk_TPOStgPtqRZ6KzmkUQBQ8TSWVX): Really good primer series on all things proofs, logic, set theory and so on. Worth a look if you're trying to grab the DAS proof points during the exam!
- [Abstract Algebra by Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdLhQs_y_E8): This series goes into a lot of depth, later on but the basic concepts from the LinAlg lectures are explained well.
