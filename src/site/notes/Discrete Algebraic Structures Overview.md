# Summary
## Dates
It's on the sheet bruh. Also see StudIP, TUNE, whatever other platforms they make up, etc....
## Tests

> [!WARNING] Tests every week
> Up to 3 Points per week, score =>16 for Studienleistung
> Everything above 16 will count towards exam!

> [!success] Try getting above 16pts in course
> Everything above 16 will count towards exam!
## Relevance to DS

- DS is very close to the sciences (meaning maths?), you'll need to build "rigorous foundations" to stay up to date in the field.
- Also: See below. Computers are **discrete calculators**
- Math is the foundation of all logical models used in Computers (cryptocurrencies, encryption, networks, error correction, etc....)

> [!DETAILS] Binary numbers
> Binary is only able to represent discrete numbers/ranges. Combinations of 0/1 can only produce a *finite amount of possible values*

## Types of math

- **Discrete**: Change in predefined steps (see natural numbers)
- Continuous: "Stepless" change, smooth value ranges (see real numbers)

> [!INFO] This is a DLA course
> So we'll only look at discrete math

## Commitment

Basic values in handout

> [!SUMMARY] 6 hour workload outside of appointments
> That's pretty much what's left after the workload at Uni. Prof says to find a study partner!!

## Having Problems?

- Ask as soon as you fall behind (tutor or prof respectively)
- You can ask during lectures
- There's a forum on StudIP

> [!WARNING] No one will answer you there
> Who the fuck is gonna use this?
> EDIT: Apparently Prof sometimes answers there

-  **Consultation hours with Prof are also available on StudIP page!**
