# Functions

> [!SUMMARY] Definition
> A function is generally defined as a mapping between **domain** (let's call that Set X) and **codomain** (Y) values.

## "-jectivity" types

- general function: codomain values can have many domain values ($f(x_1)=f(x_2) \rArr x_1=x_2$)
- injective: codomain values can have **only one** domain value (every y element Y: y=f(x))
- surjective: every codomain value must have a domain value: injective ^ surjective
- bijective: 1:1 mapping of domain to codomain values
