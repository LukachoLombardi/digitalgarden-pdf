# Cardinality
Already mentioned in [[DAS Sets Notes#Set Notation\|DAS Sets Notes#Set Notation]].
It's just the size of a set.

> Question: If set $S$ is infinite, can we say $|S| = \infty$?

$$
\{2,4,6,...\} \subseteq \mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}
$$

This implies that these "infinities" are not of the same size, since they are subsets of each other

# Countability
A Set $A$ is *countable* if there exists an injective function $f:A \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, and is *uncountable* otherwise.
$\Leftrightarrow$ a surjective function $g: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow A$  (use your head for this one).

Only countable sets can be represented by a computer.

TODO: Understand whatever this is

# Counting
$$
|A \times B| = |A| \times |B|
$$
(pretty obvious)
